We have removed several items that have been deprecated for at least one
release.

``tensorflow.python.ipu.ipu_outfeed_queue``

  - Removed ``outfeed_all`` parameter from ``IPUOutfeedQueue``.

    Use ``outfeed_mode`` parameter instead.

``tensorflow.python.ipu.ipu_pipeline_estimator``

  - Removed ``pipeline_depth`` parameter from
    ``IPUPipelineEstimatorSpec``.

    Use ``gradient_accumulation_count parameter instead``.

``tensorflow.python.ipu.utils``

  - Removed ``retain_control_dependencies`` parameter from
    ``create_ipu_config``.

    Only removed in TensorFlow 2.1.

  - Removed ``max_cross_replica_sum_buffer_size``, and
    ``max_inter_ipu_copies_buffer_size`` parameters from
    ``create_ipu_config``.

    Use ``set_optimization_options`` instead.

  - Removed ``report_options`` parameter from ``set_report_options``.

    Use ``graph_options`` and ``execution_options`` parameters instead.

  - Removed ``allow_stateful_recompute`` parameter from
    ``set_recomputation_options``.

    Pipelining recomputation will recompute all the non-stateful operations when
    recomputation is enabled.

  - Removed ``num_io_tiles`` from ``set_gcl_options``.

    Use the ``set_io_tile_options`` instead.

``tensorflow.python.ipu.ops.embedding_ops.embedding_lookup``

  - Removed ``one_hot_threshold`` and ``min_encoding_size`` parameters
    from ``embedding_lookup``.

  - Removed ``count`` parameter from ``HostEmbeddingScope.lookup``.

``tensorflow.python.ipu.ops.functional_ops``

  - Removed ``function``.

    Use ``outlined_function`` instead.

``tensorflow.python.ipu.ops.normalization_ops``

  - Removed ``reduction_axes`` parameter from ``group_norm``,
    ``layer_norm``, and ``instance_norm``.

``tensorflow.python.ipu.ops.pipelining_ops``

  - Removed ``pipeline_depth`` parameter from ``pipeline``.

    Use ``gradient_accumulation_count`` instead.

``tensorflow.python.ipu.ops.rnn_ops``

  - Removed support for passing a tuple as the ``initial_state``
    argument for ``PopnnLSTM.call``.

    This must be an ``LSTMStateTuple`` now.

The following deprecated namespace has been removed:

  * ``tensorflow.python.ipu.ipu_optimizer``

  Use the ``tensorflow.python.ipu.optimizers`` namespace instead.



Non-breaking changes
____________________

These changes are recommended.

IPUPipelineEstimator change
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The definition for ``iterations_per_loop`` has changed. Previously the number of
iterations was defined as the number of weight updates performed. The new
definition is the number of mini-batches consumed, which makes it consistent
with the IPUEstimator when using gradient accumulation. The old definition is
still used by default, but it will be removed in a future release.

Use the argument ``count_gradient_accumulation_as_iterations=True`` to use the
new definition.

Autosharding deprecated
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Autosharding has been deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. You
should now use alternative execution modes such as pipelining instead.

IPU config change
'''''''''''''''''

The ``disable_graph_convolution_caching`` parameter for ``create_ipu_config``
(from ``tensorflow.python.ipu.utils``) has been deprecated as it has no effect.
It will be removed in a future release.

The ``disable_graph_outlining`` parameter should be used instead.

IPU Keras changes [TensorFlow 2]
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``SequentialPipelineModel`` has been renamed to ``PipelineSequential`` for
consistency with its ``Model`` counterpart. The old name can still be used, but
is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

The ``accumulation_count`` argument in the constructors of the
``ipu.keras.Model`` and ``ipu.keras.Sequential`` has been renamed to
``gradient_accumulation_count`` to be consistent with the rest of the code base.
The old name can still be used, but is deprecated and will be removed in a
future release.

Similarly, ``accumulation_dtype`` has been renamed to ``gradient_accumulation_dtype``.
