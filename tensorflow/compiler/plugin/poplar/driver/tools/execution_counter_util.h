/**
 * A helper class for keeping track of the execution count in a given context.
 * For example:
 *
 * for (int i = z; i != n; ++i) {
 *   x = fn(x, i)
 * }
 *
 * `i` is the execution counter keeping track of how many times the body of the
 * loop has been executed. It has its initial value set before the loop is
 * executed and its value increases by one with each execution of the loop body.
 *
 * The execution counter can then be used to generate values which vary with
 * each execution of the body, for example random number seed generation, where
 * a new seed is required every execution of the same poplar sequence.
 *
 * When an inner scope is entered, for example:
 *
 * for (int i = z; i != n; ++i) {
 *   for (int j = i; j != n; ++j) {
 *     x = fn(x, j)
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * The inner scope inherits the initial values from the outer scope, but it
 * does not modify the counters of the outer scope.
 *
 * Care needs to be taken when the same sequence is used for multiple iterating
 * scopes (for examples pipeline stages). Independent counters for each use of
 * the same sequence need to be kept and copied in and out:
 *
 * T fn(x, &counter) {
 *   x = fn(x, counter)
 *   return x
 * }
 *
 * for (int i = z; i != n; ++i) {
 *   // fwd
 *   for (int j = i; j != n; ++j) {
 *     x = fn(x, j)
 *   }
 *   ...
 *   // recomp
 *   for (int j = i; j != n; ++j) {
 *     x = fn(x, j)
 *   }
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * Because the `fn` (the Poplar sequence) is used multiple times, the `counter`
 * can be thought of as being passed by reference, and so separate counters are
 * needed.
