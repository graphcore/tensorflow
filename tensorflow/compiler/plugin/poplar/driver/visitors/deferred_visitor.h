/**
 * An Hlo instruction visitor which deferres allocation of tensors until they
 * can be allocated with an allocation target or it is used by an instruction
 * which requires the tensor to perform an operation.
 *
 * In order to postpone the allocation, handlers for the inputs (Parameters and
 * Infeeds) check whether they have an allocation target for that input tensor
 * and if they do not, they use DeferredAllocations structure to indicate that a
 * particular input is deferred.
 * When deferring and input the following information is provided:
 * - the location of the input to the graph (instruction and the flat tuple
 * index)
 * - the allocation function which is called to allocate the tensor in the
 * Poplar graph.
 * - the post processing function which can be used to add any stream copies to
 * a sequence.
 * These functions will be called when an allocation is being made.
 *
 * This visitor implements handlers for some instructions which do not need the
 * tensor be alloacted as they do not perform any calculations.
 *
 * Specialization of the handle for GetTupleElement instruction which checks if
 * any of its inputs are deferred, and if they are:
 * - and if there is an allocation target for this location (usually generated
 * by the ForwardAllocation pass) then allocate the tensor and propagate the
 * allocation information.
 * - otherwise if there is no allocation target, mark this location as deferred.
 * If the input to the GTE already has a tensor then just forward the tensor.
 *
 * Specialization of the handle for Tuple instructions, similarly checks all the
 * input locations, and if any of them are deferred inputs then the output is
 * marked as deferred too, otherwise forward the tensor.
 *
 * For instructions with callsites - While loops, Repeat loops, Pipelines and
 * Pipeline Stages, similarly get all the deferred inputs and recursively
 * create another DeferredVisitor. Any deferred inputs will also be deferred
 * inside of this evaluator until an allocation is made.
 *
 * Note that when any of the instructions has the same tensor as an input at two
 * different locations then the allocation of that tensor is forced.
 *
 * If a deferred tensor is used by any other instructions which actually
 * requires the tensor (for example to do calculations), then the TensorMap
 * functions for getting input/output tensors will automatically create allocate
 * the tensor and call the post processing function (note that in this scenario
 * the tensor is most likely to be linearly allocate which might not be
 * optimal).
 *
 * After the visitor has finished, any deferred allocations are propagated up
 * the scope to the callsite. Depending on whether the particular operand was
 * inplace at that callsite, an additional clone of the tensor might be added.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * entry {
 *  p0 = param (0) <= allocation target convolution lhs
 *  p1 = param (1) <= allocation target convolution rhs
 *  p2 = param (2)
 *  inputs = tuple(p0, p1, p2)
 *  ROOT loop = repeat(inputs), to_apply=body
 * }
 *
 * body {
 *  args = param (0)
 *  a0 = gte(args), index=0
 *  a1 = gte(args), index=1
 *  acts = convolution(a0, a1)
 *  a2 = gte(args), index=2 <= allocation target bias add operand 1
 *  acts' = bias-add(acts, a2)
 *  ROOT t = tuple(a0, a1, acts')
 * }
 *
 * The evaluator will then first start at the entry computation and allocate p0
 * and p1 as they already have allocation targets.
 * Allocation of p2 is deferred throught the instructions p2, inputs (the tuple
 * instruction) and at the callsite to the repeat loop.
 * During the evaluation of the repeat loop, a2 eventually gets an allocation
 * target which is based on another tensor (bias add).
 * Once the evaluation the repeat loop is finished the tensor allocated for a2
 * is propagate up the scope and it is also used by p2 (as the repeat loop is
 * inplace) and the post processing function is called to add any operations for
 * that particular input.
