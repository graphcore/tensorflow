  """
  The PipelineSchedule describes how stages are interleaved on the IPUs
  servicing the pipeline.  The forward and backward passes of each stage
  will execute on the same IPUs.  So, in the core of the pipeline there is a
  choice as to whether to run the forward stages together, or the backward
  stages and the forward stages together.

  Attributes:
    Grouped: This groups the forward passes on multiple IPUs.  This requires
      more memory since activations need to be stored until the backward
      stages run together. However, since forward passes tend to be smaller
      than backward passes, Grouped tends to improve the speed of the
      execution, as different IPUs don't spend so much time waiting for each
      other.

    Interleaved: This schedules the backward passes whenever the forward
      passes have just generated some activations.  Consequently fewer
      activations are required to be stored between the forward and backward
      pipeline stages, so less memory is required.  However, since forward
      and backward stages tend to be very different in terms of execution
      cycles, the overall performance of the pipeline tends to be slower.

    Sequential: This is a debug mode, where the pipeline is scheduled in
      the same way as if it were a sharded model.

  """
  Sets up a series of computational stages, where the outputs of one stage are
  the inputs to the next one. These stages are then executed in parallel across
  multiple IPUs. This approach can be used to split the model where layer(s)
  are executed on different IPUs.

  The first stage takes the `inputs` and the `infeed_queue` (if provided) as
  its inputs. If the `infeed_queue` is provided, it is automatically dequeued
  (similar to the ipu.loops API) therefore care needs to be taken to make sure
  the signature of the first pipeline stage matches both the arguments from
  `inputs` and the `infeed_queue`, otherwise an error is thrown.

  All tensors which are used in the pipeline which are not TensorFlow
  Variables need to be explicitly passed as inputs to the pipeline. If an
  input does not change its value during the execution of the pipeline op
  (for example hyperparameters such as learning rate), it needs to be passed
  as part of `inputs`. Alternatively, if these values change during execution
  (for example the model processes different batches of data) the input should
  be passed through the `infeed_queue`
  (see :class:`~tensorflow.python.ipu.ipu_infeed_queue.IPUInfeedQueue`).

  When training a model, an optional `optimizer_function` function can be
  provided. This function takes all the outputs from the last computational
  stage as inputs, and returns an instance of `OptimizerFunctionOutput` that
  is used to generate the backwards pass of the model using the TensorFlow
  Optimizer API. This will internally create corresponding backpropagation
  pipeline stages for each pipeline stage and colocate them such that the
  activations and weights required for the gradient calculation and
  application stay on the device in order to minimise the number of copies
  between IPUs.

  Note that the gradients, which are calculated by the `compute_gradients`
  function, will be accumulated automatically during the execution of the
  pipeline, unless `continuous_weight_updates` is enabled.

  If the last computational stage has any outputs, then an `outfeed_queue`
  (see :class:`~tensorflow.python.ipu.ipu_outfeed_queue.IPUOutfeedQueue`)
  is required and all the outputs from the last computational stage are enqueued
  to the `outfeed_queue`.

  Note that pipelining also supports recomputation, to enable it, use the
  `tensorflow.ipu.utils.set_recomputation_options()` function when configuring
  the device.

  For example a simple inference network for the MNIST can be split across two
  IPUs:

  .. code-block:: python

    from tensorflow import keras

    # Create the dataset
    #...

    # Create the data queues from/to IPU.
    infeed_queue = ipu_infeed_queue.IPUInfeedQueue(dataset, "infeed")
    outfeed_queue = ipu_outfeed_queue.IPUOutfeedQueue("outfeed")

    # Create a pipelined model which is split accross two stages.
    def stage1(image):
      partial = keras.layers.Dense(256, activation=tf.nn.relu)(image)
      partial = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=tf.nn.relu)(partial)
      return partial

    def stage2(partial):
      logits = keras.layers.Dense(10)(partial)
      probabilities = tf.nn.softmax(logits)
      classes = tf.argmax(input=logits, axis=1)
      return probabilities, classes

    def model():
      with variable_scope.variable_scope("vs", use_resource=True):
        pipeline_op = pipelining_ops.pipeline(
                          computational_stages=[stage1, stage2],
                          pipeline_depth=250,
                          repeat_count=2,
                          inputs=[],
                          infeed_queue=infeed_queue,
                          outfeed_queue=outfeed_queue,
                          device_mapping=[3,1],
                          name="Pipeline")
      return pipeline_op

    with ops.device("/device:IPU:0"):
      compiled_model = ipu_compiler.compile(model, inputs=[])

    outfeed_op = outfeed_queue.dequeue()
    with tf.Session() as sess:
      result = sess.run(compiled_model)
      probabilities, classes = sess.run(outfeed_op)

  In this set up, the model is split across two IPUs. By default the first two
  layers would be executed on the first IPU and the third layer and the
  probabilities and classes on the second IPU but here `device_mapping` is
  used to override the default IPU allocation and instead the first two layers
  will be executed on the fourth IPU and the third layer and the probabilities
  and classed on the second IPU.

  This creates a pipeline of depth 250 (specified by the `pipeline_depth`),
  which means each pipeline stage is executed 250 times.

  This pipeline is then executed 2 times (specified by the `repeat_count`)
  The results of the pipeline (probabilities and classes) are returned to the
  host by the outfeed queue.

  We can also train this network by providing `optimizer_function`:

  .. code-block:: python

    from tensorflow import keras

    # Create the dataset
    #...

    # Create the data queues from/to IPU.
    infeed_queue = ipu_infeed_queue.IPUInfeedQueue(dataset, "infeed")
    outfeed_queue = ipu_outfeed_queue.IPUOutfeedQueue("outfeed")

    # Create a pipelined model which is split accross two stages.
    def stage1(lr, images, labels):
      partial = keras.layers.Dense(256, activation=tf.nn.relu)(images)
      partial = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=tf.nn.relu)(partial)
      return lr, partial, labels

    def stage2(lr, partial, labels):
      logits = keras.layers.Dense(10)(partial)
      cross_entropy = tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(
                            labels=labels, logits=logits)
      loss = tf.reduce_mean(cross_entropy)
      return lr, loss

    def optimizer_function(lr, loss):
      optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(lr)
      return pipelining_ops.OptimizerFunctionOutput(optimizer, loss)

    def model(lr):
      with variable_scope.variable_scope("vs", use_resource=True):
        pipeline_op = pipelining_ops.pipeline(
                          computational_stages=[stage1, stage2],
                          pipeline_depth=128,
                          repeat_count=10,
                          inputs=[lr],
                          infeed_queue=infeed_queue,
                          outfeed_queue=outfeed_queue,
                          optimizer_function=optimizer_function,
                          name="Pipeline")
      return pipeline_op

    with ops.device('cpu'):
      lr = tf.placeholder(np.float16, [])

    with ops.device("/device:IPU:0"):
      compiled_model = ipu_compiler.compile(model, inputs=[lr])

    outfeed_op = outfeed_queue.dequeue()
    with tf.Session() as sess:
      result = sess.run(compiled_model, {lr: 0.01})
      losses = sess.run(outfeed_op)

  Here the `tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer` generates the pipeline stages
  which calculate the gradients and apply them to the weights. Note how the
  loss is returned to the host by the outfeed queue.

  If a model requires multiple computational pipeline stages to access the same
  `tf.Variable`, then all of these computational stages need to be placed on the
  same IPU using the `device_mapping` argument.

  Note that modifying `tf.Variable` values in a pipeline stage and/or during the
  gradient calculation will result in undefined behavior. These variables can
  only be modified by the `apply_gradients` member function of the applied
  Optimizer.

  Args:
    computational_stages: a list of python functions, where each function
      represents a computational pipeline stage. The function takes the
      outputs of the previous pipeline state as its inputs.
    pipeline_depth: the number of times each pipeline stage will be executed.
    repeat_count: the number of times the pipeline will be executed.
    batch_serialization_iterations: number of times a loop executes to compute a
      batch on each pipeline stage execution. Currently only supported with the
      `PipelineSchedule.Sequential`.
    inputs: arguments passed to the first pipeline stage.
    infeed_queue: optional IPUInfeedQueue, if passed, it is dequeued and
      passed as an input in the first pipeline stage.
    outfeed_queue: IPUOutfeedQueue, required if the last computational stage
      has any outputs. The outputs of these are enqueued to this queue and
      they can be accessed on the host.
    optimizer_function: optional Python function which takes the output of the
      last computational stage as parameters and returns an instance of
      `pipelining_ops.OptimizerFunctionOutput` in order to generate the
      back-propagation and weight-update parts of the model suitable for
      training.
    device_mapping: If provided, a list of length equal to the number of
      computational stages. An element at index `i` in the list represents which
      IPU the computational stage `computational_stages[i]` should reside on.
      This can be used to make sure computational stages which share
      `tf.Variable`s are resident on the same IPU.
    pipeline_schedule: Which scheduling algorithm to use for pipeline
      lowering. Defaults to `PipelineSchedule.Grouped`.
    forward_propagation_stages_poplar_options: If provided, a list of length
      equal to the number of computational stages. Each element is a
      PipelineStageOptions object which allows for fine grain control of the
      Poplar options for a given forward propagation computational stage.
    backward_propagation_stages_poplar_options: If provided, a list of length
      equal to the number of computational stages. Each element is a
      PipelineStageOptions object which allows for fine grained control of the
      Poplar options for a given backward propagation computational stage.
    weight_update_poplar_options: If provided, a PipelineStageOptions object
      which allows for fine grained control of the Poplar options for the
      weight update stage.
    offload_weight_update_variables: If True, any `tf.Variable` which is
      only used by the weight update of the pipeline (for example the
      accumulator variable when using the `tf.MomentumOptimizer`), will be
      stored in the remote memory. During the weight update this variable will
      be streamed onto the device and then streamed back to the remote memory
      after it has been updated. Requires the machine to be configured with
      support for `Poplar remote buffers`. Offloading variables into remote
      memory can reduce maximum memory liveness, but can also increase the
      computation time of the weight update. Note that this option has no effect
      for inference only pipelines.
    continuous_weight_updates: ** CURRENTLY UNIMPLEMENTED ** When training,
      this option will apply the gradients to the resource variables
      immediately, rather than accumulating the gradients and applying them
      at the end of each execution of the pipeline.
    outfeed_loss: If True, the loss given by the `optimizer_function` will
      be enqueued on the outfeed, instead of the outputs from the last
      computational stage.
    name: name of this pipeline.
