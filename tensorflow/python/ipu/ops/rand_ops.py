  """This targets the PopLibs Poprand operation, optimized for execution
  on the IPU.

  With probability `rate`, drops elements of `x`. Inputs which are kept are
  scaled up by `1 / (1 - rate)` such that the expected sum is unchanged.

  Args:
    x: The input tensor.
    seed: An optional two-element tensor-like object (`tf.Tensor`, a numpy array
      or Python list/tuple), representing the random seed that will be used to
      create the distribution for dropout.
    rate: The probability that a given element will be zeroed out.
    seed_modifier: An optional parameter given to poplar which uses it to modify
                   the seed.
    noise_shape: An optional parameter that determines the shape of the dropout. 
                 Regular, unshaped dropout used if not specified.
    scale: No longer valid.
    name: Optional op name.

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` which has some nodes set to zero, as randomly selected based on
    other parameters.
