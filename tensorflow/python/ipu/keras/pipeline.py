  """Keras Model for encapsulating a pipeline of stages to be run in parallel
  on an IPU system.

  A pipelined model will execute multiple sections (stages) of a model on more
  than one IPU at the same time, by pipelining mini-batches of data through
  the stages.

  It encapsulates the ipu.pipelining_ops.pipeline operation and the associated
  InFeed and OutFeed queues into a class which resembles the Keras Model class
  and provides the `fit` API for training the model.

  The different stages are specified, similarly to the Keras Sequential model,
  as a list in the constructor.  With the PipelinedModel class the list of
  layers becomes a list of lists of layers, where each list contains the layers
  for a particular stage.

  The pipeline depth argument describes the number of mini-batches which are
  sent through the pipeline in a single operation of the pipeline.  The
  effective batch size is therefore the mini-batch size multipled by the
  pipeline depth.

  There are some limitations with the PipelinedModel compared to the standard
  Keras Model.

  - The input must be provided by a tf.DataSet.
  - Keras V1 optimizers cannot be used.
  - Loss weightings can only be specified as a list, not a callable.
  - Weighted metrics, target tensors and sample weight mode are not supported.
  - Validation cannot be performed as part of the `fit` loop.
  - The model cannot be called using the __call__() interface.

  The model will only be constructed after the first call to the `fit` method,
  so a summary of the model will not be possible until after some training
  has occurred.  Related to this, the `build` method does not build the
  model.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: python

    dataset = ...

    strategy = ipu.ipu_strategy.IPUStrategy()
    with strategy.scope():
      m = ipu.keras.PipelinedModel([
        [
          keras.layers.Dense(4),
          keras.layers.Dense(4),
          keras.layers.Dense(4),
        ],
        [
          keras.layers.Dense(8),
        ],
      ], pipeline_depth=24)

      m.compile('sgd', loss='mse')

      m.fit(dataset, steps_per_epoch=144)
