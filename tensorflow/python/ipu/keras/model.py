        `tf.keras.losses.Loss` instance. See `tf.keras.losses`.
        IPU-specific loss classes can also be used. See the documentation in
        :py:mod:`tensorflow.python.ipu.keras.losses` for usage instructions.
        An objective function is any callable with the signature
        `scalar_loss = fn(y_true, y_pred)`. If the model has multiple outputs,
        you can use a different loss on each output by passing a dictionary or
        a list of losses. The loss value that will be minimized by the model
        will then be the sum of all individual losses.
      metrics: List of metrics to be evaluated by the model during training and
        testing. Typically you will use `metrics=['accuracy']`. To specify
        different metrics for different outputs of a multi-output model, you
        could pass a dictionary, such as `metrics={'output_a': 'accuracy',
        'output_b': ['accuracy', 'mse']}`, or a list (`len = len(outputs)`) of
        lists of metrics such as
        `metrics=[['accuracy'], ['accuracy', 'mse']]` or `metrics=['accuracy',
        ['accuracy', 'mse']]`.
      loss_weights: Optional list specifying scalar coefficients (Python floats)
        to weight the loss contributions of different model outputs. The loss
        value that will be minimized by the model will then be the weighted sum
        of all individual losses, weighted by the loss_weights coefficients.
        The list is expected to have a 1:1 mapping to the model's outputs.

    This provides equivalent functionality to the Keras Sequential `fit` method.

    Note that `batch_size` here is the number of samples that is processed on
    each replica in each forward pass. This is referred to as the mini-batch
    size. Prepare Dataset input on this basis.

    Each step (per replica) will process mini-batch multiplied by gradient
    accumulation count samples before updating the weights. Therefore, the
    effective batch size for a weight update is the mini-batch size multiplied
    by the gradient accumulation count multiplied by the replication factor.

    The number of weight update steps per epoch is the `steps_per_epoch` value
    divided by the replication factor, and this is the number of steps that
    will be shown in the progress bar.

    For a finite dataset the iterator over the data will be reset at the start
    of each epoch. This means that the dataset does not need to be repeated
    `epochs` times if `steps_per_epoch` is not specified. It also means that if
    a small value for `steps_per_epoch` is supplied then not all samples will be
    used.

    A shuffled Dataset should be supplied. Non-dataset inputs (as described in
    the parameters section below) for `x` and `y` will be accepted but will not
    be shuffled, and this may lead to over-fitting.

    Input/Target data of the following types will be converted into a Dataset
    internally based on the batch_size, dropping any partial batch: Numpy array
    (or list of arrays), TensorFlow tensor (or list of tensors) or dict.

    Only the parameters documented below are supported.

    Args:
      x: Input data.
        It could be:

        - A Numpy array (or array-like), or a list of arrays (in case the model
          has multiple inputs).
        - A TensorFlow tensor, or a list of tensors (in case the model has
          multiple inputs).
        - A dict mapping input names to the corresponding array/tensors, if the
          model has named inputs.
        - A `tf.data` dataset. This must return a tuple of `(inputs, targets)`.
      y: Target data. Like the input data `x`, it could be either Numpy array(s)
        or TensorFlow tensor(s). It should be consistent with `x` (you cannot
        have Numpy inputs and tensor targets, or tensor inputs and Numpy
        targets). If `x` is a dataset then `y` must not be specified (since
        targets will be obtained from `x`).
      batch_size: Integer or `None`. The mini-batch size to use for input data
        supplied as Numpy array(s) or TensorFlow tensor(s). If `x` is a dataset
        then `batch_size` must not be specified.
      epochs: Integer. Number of epochs to train the model. The number of steps
        performed per epoch is defined by the `steps_per_epoch` parameter, or
        calculated according to the constraints described below.
        Note that in conjunction with `initial_epoch`, `epochs` is to be
        understood as "final epoch". The model is not trained for a number of
        iterations given by `epochs`, but merely until the epoch of index
        `epochs` is reached.
      verbose: 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode. 0 = silent, 1 = progress bar,
        2 = one line per epoch. Note that the progress bar is not particularly
        useful when logged to a file, so verbose=2 is recommended when not
        running interactively (for example, in a production environment).
      callbacks: List of `keras.callbacks.Callback` instances. List of callbacks
        to apply during training. See `tf.keras.callbacks` in the TensorFlow
        documentation.
      shuffle: **NOT SUPPORTED**. This will be supported in a future release.
      initial_epoch: Integer. Epoch at which to start training (useful for
        resuming a previous training run).
      steps_per_epoch: Integer or `None`. Specifies the total number of steps to
        be performed per epoch.
        The following constraints apply:

        - If `steps_per_run` is specified then the value for `steps_per_epoch`
          must be evenly divisible by `steps_per_run` multiplied by the
          replication factor. Otherwise it must be divisible by the
          replication factor.
        - For an infinitely repeating dataset a value for `steps_per_epoch`
          must be specified.
        - For a finite dataset if `steps_per_epoch` is specified then it must
          contain at least mini-batch size * gradient accumulation count *
          `steps` samples.
        - For a dataset of known finite length a value for `steps_per_epoch`
          will be calculated if no value is specified. The number of
          samples in the dataset must be a multiple of the mini-batch size
          multiplied by the gradient accumulation count multiplied by the
          replication factor (multiplied by `steps_per_run` if it is
          specified).
        - For array or tensor inputs a value for `steps_per_epoch` will be
          calculated if no value is specified. If the number of samples provided
          is not a multiple of the mini-batch size multiplied by the gradient
          accumulation count multiplied by the replication factor (multiplied by
          `steps_per_run` if it is specified) then samples will be dropped when
          deriving a value for `steps_per_epoch` and a warning will be logged.
      steps_per_run: Integer or `None`. Specifies how many steps will be
        performed per replica on each hardware execution.
        If not specified this will be set to `steps_per_epoch` (which will
        be calculated if not specified) divided by the replication factor.
        The value of 'steps_per_epoch' (if specified) must be evenly
        divisible by `steps_per_run` multiplied by the replication factor.
      prefetch_depth: Integer or `None`. The `prefetch_depth` to be used by the
        :class:`~tensorflow.python.ipu.ipu_infeed_queue.IPUInfeedQueue`
        that is created internally by this function. See the
        :class:`~tensorflow.python.ipu.ipu_infeed_queue.IPUInfeedQueue`
        documentation.
    Returns:
      A `History` object. Its `History.history` attribute is a record of
      training loss values and metrics values at successive epochs.
    Raises:
      ValueError: if there are invalid arguments.

  """A Keras Model class specifically targeting the IPU.  This is
  similar to the Keras Model class, but it also supports the accumulation of
  gradient deltas, and an on-device training/inference loop.

  There are some limitations with the IPU Model class compared to the standard
  Keras Model class:

  - Keras V1 optimizers cannot be used.
  - Loss weightings can only be specified as a list, not a callable.
  - Weighted metrics, target tensors and sample weight mode are not supported.
  - Validation cannot be performed as part of the `fit` loop.
  - The model cannot be called using the __call__() interface.
  - The model cannot be saved using the `save` interface.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: python

    dataset = ...

    strategy = ipu.ipu_strategy.IPUStrategy()
    with strategy.scope():
      inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))

      # Add some more vertices to the graph.
      x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu")(inputs)
      x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu")(x)
      x = keras.layers.Dense(10)(x)

      model = ipu.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)
      model.compile(
        loss=keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
        optimizer=keras.optimizers.RMSprop(),
        metrics=["accuracy"])

      model.fit(dataset, epochs=2, steps_per_epoch=128)

    This provides the same functionality as the Keras Model ``compile`` method.

    Certain features are not supported by the IPU Model:

      - sample_weight_mode
      - weighted_metrics
      - target_tensors

    Note that loss weights can only be specified as a list.

    Args:
      optimizer: String (name of optimizer) or optimizer instance. See
        `tf.keras.optimizers`. An instance of a subclass of
        `tensorflow.python.training.optimizer` can also be used.
      loss: String (name of objective function), objective function or
        `tf.keras.losses.Loss` instance. See `tf.keras.losses`.
        IPU-specific loss classes can also be used. See the documentation in
        :py:mod:`tensorflow.python.ipu.keras.losses` for usage instructions.
        An objective function is any callable with the signature
        `scalar_loss = fn(y_true, y_pred)`. If the model has multiple outputs,
        you can use a different loss on each output by passing a dictionary or
        a list of losses. The loss value that will be minimized by the model
        will then be the sum of all individual losses.
      metrics: List of metrics to be evaluated by the model during training and
        testing. Typically you will use `metrics=['accuracy']`. To specify
        different metrics for different outputs of a multi-output model, you
        could pass a dictionary, such as `metrics={'output_a': 'accuracy',
        'output_b': ['accuracy', 'mse']}`, or a list (`len = len(outputs)`) of
        lists of metrics such as
        `metrics=[['accuracy'], ['accuracy', 'mse']]` or `metrics=['accuracy',
        ['accuracy', 'mse']]`.
      loss_weights: Optional list specifying scalar coefficients (Python floats)
        to weight the loss contributions of different model outputs. The loss

    This provides equivalent functionality to the Keras Model `fit` method.

    Note that `batch_size` here is the number of samples that is processed on
    each replica in each forward pass. This is referred to as the mini-batch
    size. Prepare Dataset input on this basis.

    Each step (per replica) will process mini-batch multiplied by gradient
    accumulation count samples before updating the weights. Therefore, the
    effective batch size for a weight update is the mini-batch size multiplied
    by the gradient accumulation count multiplied by the replication factor.

    The number of weight update steps per epoch is the `steps_per_epoch` value
    divided by the replication factor, and this is the number of steps that
    will be shown in the progress bar.

    For a finite dataset the iterator over the data will be reset at the start
    of each epoch. This means that the dataset does not need to be repeated
    `epochs` times if `steps_per_epoch` is not specified. It also means that if
    a small value for `steps_per_epoch` is supplied then not all samples will be
    used.

    A shuffled Dataset should be supplied. Non-dataset inputs (as described in
    the parameters section below) for `x` and `y` will be accepted but will not
    be shuffled, and this may lead to over-fitting.

    Input/Target data of the following types will be converted into a Dataset
    internally based on the batch_size, dropping any partial batch: Numpy array
    (or list of arrays), TensorFlow tensor (or list of tensors) or dict.

    Only the parameters documented below are supported.

    Args:
      x: Input data.
        It could be:

        - A Numpy array (or array-like), or a list of arrays (in case the model
          has multiple inputs).
        - A TensorFlow tensor, or a list of tensors (in case the model has
          multiple inputs).
        - A dict mapping input names to the corresponding array/tensors, if the
          model has named inputs.
        - A `tf.data` dataset. This must return a tuple of `(inputs, targets)`.
      y: Target data. Like the input data `x`, it could be either Numpy array(s)
        or TensorFlow tensor(s). It should be consistent with `x` (you cannot
        have Numpy inputs and tensor targets, or tensor inputs and Numpy
        targets). If `x` is a dataset then `y` must not be specified (since
        targets will be obtained from `x`).
      batch_size: Integer or `None`. The mini-batch size to use for input data
        supplied as Numpy array(s) or TensorFlow tensor(s). If `x` is a dataset
        then `batch_size` must not be specified.
      epochs: Integer. Number of epochs to train the model. The number of steps
        performed per epoch is defined by the `steps_per_epoch` parameter, or
        calculated according to the constraints described below.
        Note that in conjunction with `initial_epoch`, `epochs` is to be
        understood as "final epoch". The model is not trained for a number of
        iterations given by `epochs`, but merely until the epoch of index
        `epochs` is reached.
      verbose: 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode. 0 = silent, 1 = progress bar,
        2 = one line per epoch. Note that the progress bar is not particularly
        useful when logged to a file, so verbose=2 is recommended when not
        running interactively (for example, in a production environment).
      callbacks: List of `keras.callbacks.Callback` instances. List of callbacks
        to apply during training. See `tf.keras.callbacks` in the TensorFlow
        documentation.
      shuffle: **NOT SUPPORTED**. This will be supported in a future release.
      initial_epoch: Integer. Epoch at which to start training (useful for
        resuming a previous training run).
      steps_per_epoch: Integer or `None`. Specifies the total number of steps to
        be performed per epoch.
        The following constraints apply:

        - If `steps_per_run` is specified then the value for `steps_per_epoch`
          must be evenly divisible by `steps_per_run` multiplied by the
          replication factor. Otherwise it must be divisible by the
          replication factor.
        - For an infinitely repeating dataset a value for `steps_per_epoch`
          must be specified.
        - For a finite dataset if `steps_per_epoch` is specified then it must
          contain at least mini-batch size * gradient accumulation count *
          `steps` samples.
        - For a dataset of known finite length a value for `steps_per_epoch`
          will be calculated if no value is specified. The number of
          samples in the dataset must be a multiple of the mini-batch size
          multiplied by the gradient accumulation count multiplied by the
          replication factor (multiplied by `steps_per_run` if it is
          specified).
        - For array or tensor inputs a value for `steps_per_epoch` will be
          calculated if no value is specified. If the number of samples provided
          is not a multiple of the mini-batch size multiplied by the gradient
          accumulation count multiplied by the replication factor (multiplied by
          `steps_per_run` if it is specified) then samples will be dropped when
          deriving a value for `steps_per_epoch` and a warning will be logged.
      steps_per_run: Integer or `None`. Specifies how many steps will be
        performed per replica on each hardware execution.
        If not specified this will be set to `steps_per_epoch` (which will
        be calculated if not specified) divided by the replication factor.
        The value of 'steps_per_epoch' (if specified) must be evenly
        divisible by `steps_per_run` multiplied by the replication factor.
      prefetch_depth: Integer or `None`. The `prefetch_depth` to be used by the
        :class:`~tensorflow.python.ipu.ipu_infeed_queue.IPUInfeedQueue`
        that is created internally by this function. See the
        :class:`~tensorflow.python.ipu.ipu_infeed_queue.IPUInfeedQueue`
        documentation.
    Returns:
      A `History` object. Its `History.history` attribute is a record of
      training loss values and metrics values at successive epochs.
    Raises:
      ValueError: if there are invalid arguments.
